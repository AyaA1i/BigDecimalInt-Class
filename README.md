# BigDecimalInt-Class
The type int exist in C++ and other languages is limited 
by min and max values depending on the number of bytes used to store the number. We need 
versions with unlimited bounds.

This is a new C++ class that can hold a real number with unlimited number of digits, supporting math functions and
arithmetic operations such as: +, -, <, and >. 

## Some Features:
* Adding two numbers using ( + operator ).
* Subtracting two numbers using ( - operator ).
* Comparing two numbers using ( < & > & == operators ).
* Using output stream with BigDecimalInt objects.
